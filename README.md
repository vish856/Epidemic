# Epidemic
writing a program that simulates the spread of an infectious disease throughout a population. Using classes, you will model an individual person’s and an entire population’s attributes and behaviors. Your program will allow users to set various initial conditions in regards to the infection such as population size, infection rate, mortality rate, and infection duration. The program will then simulate the interaction of people within a population and spread the disease. Each iteration of spreading the disease will result in a summary displaying statistics of the population.
